*"The scriptural Word knows of two kinds of knowledge of divine things. On one hand, there is relative knowledge, rooted only in reason and ideas... on the other hand, there is that truly authentic knowledge, gained only by actual experience, apart from reason and ideas, which provides a total perception of the known object through a participation (**methexis**) by grace." - St. Maximus the Confessor*

### About Thad

Thaddeus Hughes is the illustrator and creator of Methexis Studio. Thaddeus spent several years in the Melkite Catholic Church, where he gained an appreciation for iconography. He's always enjoyed good illustration, especially woodcut / blackwork.

### Materials and Finish

Most icons are alder or maple. Icons are finished with a blend of tung and orange oil. This can be quite fragrant, but it will fade over time. (Note: some old inventory is finished with a lacquer instead of oil).

### Shipping

Icons are produced on a weekly basis. Please allow a few days for products to ship.
