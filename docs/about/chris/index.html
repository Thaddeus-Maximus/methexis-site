&lt;p&gt;Chris grew up as a cradle Catholic in Naperville, Illinois. His parents involved him with his parish from a young age going to mass and praying together every night. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until college, that he really grew close to the Catholic church. While attending Illinois State University, he regularly attended the John Paul II Catholic Newman Center where he deepened his relationship with Christ through bible studies, eucharistic adoration, and retreats. After college, he continued to help with a local youth ministry and was involved in many different young adult groups. Along with leading BloNo Catholic, he is a Firefighter/Paramedic for the City of Bloomington and works 3 other EMS jobs.&lt;/p&gt;">
